The reason for doubling the resolution is that it increases the number of pixels, providing more room for editing. Once you&#39;ve done this, open an image editor of your choice, select the new emoji, resize it, and center it within the emoji slot. This will give the emoji more space around it when used in the game.</p>',9))])}const _=p(c,[["render",m]]);export{E as __pageData,_ as default};
