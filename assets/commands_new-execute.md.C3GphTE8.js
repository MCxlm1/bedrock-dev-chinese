While the syntax is now more verbose and longer to write, it allows much finer control over the contextual components of commands and adds support for conditions to commands, superseding the use of commands like <code class="shiki"><span>/testfor</span></code>, <code class="shiki"><span>/testforblock</span></code>, and <code class="shiki"><span>/testforblocks</span></code>.</p><p>Before we dive into the syntax and how to write it, we need to understand how the old <code class="shiki"><span>/execute</span></code> command worked, and what changed and why. This will make explaining the concepts found in the syntax easier.</p><h2 id="understanding-execution-context" tabindex="-1">Understanding Execution Context <a class="header-anchor" href="#understanding-execution-context" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Understanding Execution Context&quot;">​</a></h2><p>For both beginners to commands and those well versed in how old <code class="shiki"><span>/execute</span></code> behaved, it may be a good idea to review the concept of a command&#39;s <strong>execution context</strong>.</p><p>In short, these are the parameters that affects how a command runs. Who the command will run as, also known as its executor; where the command will run, and in which dimension; and the rotation applied to the command are all parameters that can be changed.</p><p>Every command has this context applied to it, and this context changes depending on how the command runs. Commands fired from command blocks do not have an executor, and the position is set to that command block; commands ran from chat define the executor as the player, and it runs at the player&#39;s position.</p><h2 id="execute-and-why-it-changed" tabindex="-1">Execute, and Why it Changed <a class="header-anchor" href="#execute-and-why-it-changed" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Execute, and Why it Changed&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The <code class="shiki"><span>/execute</span></code> command executes a command on behalf of one or more entities.
