Version control could be achieved at the most basic level by taking a <code class="shiki"><span>.zip</span></code> of your add-on every day (or every version) and uploading it to google drive (or saving locally). This isn&#39;t unreasonable, but it has three significant difficulties that proper VCS (version control systems) fix:</p><ul><li>It isn&#39;t easy to compare versions</li><li>It isn&#39;t easy to <em>actually</em> roll-back to a previous version</li><li>It doesn&#39;t do anything to help in team-collaboration</li></ul><p>This tutorial will teach the basics of a tool called <code class="shiki"><span>git</span></code>, and a free, online git storage service called `GitHub. Anyone may follow along, but you will receive the most benefit if you are working in a team environment or often lose your work because you forget to back up.</p><p>This tutorial will not be focusing directly on teaching <code class="shiki"><span>git</span></code> or <code class="shiki"><span>GitHub</span></code>, as outside knowledge sources better do this. The focus will be on setting up these tools for Minecraft once the basics have been learned.</p><h2 id="git" tabindex="-1">Git <a class="header-anchor" href="#git" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Git&quot;">​</a></h2><p><code class="shiki"><span>git</span></code> is a tool installed locally on your machine and allows you to version your files. You can <code class="shiki"><span>commit</span></code> changes to your files with a small message (ex. &quot;Fixed issue where dragons couldn&#39;t fly after being tamed&quot;), view the full change-list, and quickly jump back to specific changes.</p><p>Git is insanely powerful and the de-facto tool for all major programming projects. The most significant drawback for MC work is that it is <em>complicated</em>. Be patient while learning.</p><p>For a complete walkthrough of <code class="shiki"><span>git</span></code>, you should follow the following <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-git" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">git tutorial.</a></p><h2 id="github" tabindex="-1">GitHub <a class="header-anchor" href="#github" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;GitHub&quot;">​</a></h2><p>GitHub is a version of your git project (<code class="shiki"><span>repository</span></code>) that is hosted online. This allows multiple people to work on the same project at the same time and collaborate. This is very helpful for map-making. By hosting on Github, you can also (optionally) make your code public, making it easier than ever to share your add-ons with the world.</p><p>For a complete walkthrough of using <code class="shiki"><span>Github</span></code>, you should follow this <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">github tutorial</a>.</p><h2 id="vocabulary-quiz" tabindex="-1">Vocabulary Quiz <a class="header-anchor" href="#vocabulary-quiz" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Vocabulary Quiz&quot;">​</a></h2><p>If you&#39;ve gotten this far, hopefully, you have a GitHub account and are familiar with <code class="shiki"><span>git</span></code> in a small way. The following terms will be used in this tutorial.

The steps are similar if you are starting from scratch.</p><h3 id="structure" tabindex="-1">Structure <a class="header-anchor" href="#structure" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Structure&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The big issue with using <code class="shiki"><span>git</span></code> for add-ons is that <code class="shiki"><span>git</span></code> generally works by encapsulating a <em>single</em> folder and managing it. Of course, in Bedrock Add-Ons, assets are spread across two folders: The <code class="shiki"><span>BP</span></code>, and <code class="shiki"><span>RP</span></code>. To get around this issue, we will place our repository outside of the <code class="shiki"><span>com.mojang</span></code> folder entirely and then use window <code class="shiki"><span>junctions</span></code> to &quot;copy&quot; the folders in.</p><p>There are many advantages of placing our project in a separate location:</p><ul><li>We can include additional files as needed, such as config files, tools, notes, .bb files, etc</li><li>We can combine the RP and the BP into one repository</li><li>All of our projects can be easily viewed in a simple location, instead of nested deep within com.mojang</li></ul><h3 id="creating-a-git-repository" tabindex="-1">Creating a Git Repository <a class="header-anchor" href="#creating-a-git-repository" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Creating a Git Repository&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Pick a convenient location for your projects. I placed mine at <code class="shiki"><span>C:/sirlich/projects</span></code>. Make a new folder with the name of your map. We will be using <code class="shiki"><span>wiki</span></code> as the name of our mock project.</p><p>Right-click the folder, and click <code class="shiki"><span>&quot;Open git Bash&quot;</span></code>. If this option doesn&#39;t appear, you can open <code class="shiki"><span>git bash</span></code> from the start menu and navigate your project folder. If you don&#39;t have <code class="shiki"><span>git bash</span></code> installed, you should do so now.</p><p>Type: <code class="shiki"><span>git init</span></code>. This will create a blank repository in your project.</p><h3 id="linking-your-existing-rp-and-bp" tabindex="-1">Linking Your Existing RP and BP <a class="header-anchor" href="#linking-your-existing-rp-and-bp" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Linking Your Existing RP and BP&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The next step is to make the repository aware of your RP and BP folders. We will be using window symlink &quot;junctions&quot;. When we create a junction, we essentially create a wormhole in our file system that will make it appear like your files are in two places at once. Deleting/editing/adding files is perfectly copied over.</p><p>Type: <code class="shiki"><span>mklink /J wiki_RP &quot;C:/path/to/RP/in/com/mojang&quot;</span></code> Type: <code class="shiki"><span>mklink /J wiki_BP &quot;C:/path/to/BP/in/com/mojang&quot;</span></code></p><p>When you are finished, you should see <code class="shiki"><span>wiki_RP</span></code> and <code class="shiki"><span>wiki_BP</span></code> in your project folder, containing all your assets, existing files, etc.</p><p>You can now push this repository to <code class="shiki"><span>github</span></code>, following the tutorial above.</p><h3 id="extra-files" tabindex="-1">Extra Files <a class="header-anchor" href="#extra-files" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Extra Files&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Because we created our repository based on symlinks, we can add anything we like into the project folder without worrying about breaking the com.mojang folder. I like to track <code class="shiki"><span>.bb</span></code> files, cover-art files (<code class="shiki"><span>.kra</span></code> etc.).</p><p>You can also add notes, video files, or anything else you want to track.</p><h3 id="working-with-your-vcs" tabindex="-1">Working With Your VCS <a class="header-anchor" href="#working-with-your-vcs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Working With Your VCS&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The main things to remember about working with VCS:</p><ul><li>Always <code class="shiki"><span>pull</span></code> before starting work</li><li>Commit and <code class="shiki"><span>push</span></code> often</li><li>Always <code class="shiki"><span>push</span></code> before stopping work</li><li>If you screw up your files super bad, you can always reset to the last working version.
