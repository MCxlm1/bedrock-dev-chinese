This page demonstrates different methods of presenting structures, allowing you to showcase your add-on and its features.

## Presentation Methods

There are lots ways of you could showcase structures to people. You can:

-   Take in-game screenshots of the structure.
-   Take a screenshot inside of a structure block.
-   Create a 3D object of your structure.

Below all three methods will be shown using the Pillager outpost structure as an example.

### In-Game Screenshot

This is the simplest method because it is quick and easy. It also lets you showcase the structure in the context of the world, there are some disadvantages however. You may need to find a good place to take a screenshot or have difficulty finding a good angle.

### In a Structure Block

This method avoids some of the disadvantages of a screenshot in the world, you are able to focus entirely on the structure without other blocks in the view.

By making [JSON UI](/json-ui/json-ui-intro) edits you can change the background color and remove other elements to further improve this method.

Or you can use the **Structure Presentation Pack** by @minato4743 to simplify the process. It includes some default colors and gradients as well as a toggle to hide the preview arrows.

### Rendered 3D Object

Structures can be exported as a 3D model from the Structure Block UI.

This method is only available for Windows users.
You can create a simple render in Paint 3D or a more advanced render in Blender.
