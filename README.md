This wiki is a knowledge-sharing website for technical features of Minecraft Bedrock, containing documentation, tutorials, and general how-to information.

## Contributing

Have you found a typo, been frustrated by an overly complicated guide or just want to write your own guide to help other users create their own add-ons?
Well, you've come to the right place!

Our Bedrock Wiki is fully open-source and is maintained by our lovely community, which keeps growing!
If you want to be part of this community, get help on add-ons or just want to expand our wiki, you can join our Discord servers:

-   [Bedrock OSS](https://discord.gg/XjV87YN) — for wiki contributing and cool projects,
-   [Bedrock Add-Ons](https://discord.gg/pytC8zKHPn) — for help with add-ons.

If you want to help us create more complex things, like adding a new page or fixing some typos yourself, we have a dedicated [contributing guide](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/contribute) on our wiki which describes every step you need to follow.
If you have some questions, there are some really nice people in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/XjV87YN).

### Code & Platform

The wiki uses a custom [VitePress theme](https://vitepress.dev), and is statically generated from the `wiki` branch to the `generated` branch.

If you are interested in helping us maintain the core platform, as opposed to the Markdown articles, [join the Discord](https://discord.gg/XjV87YN)!

### Running Locally
